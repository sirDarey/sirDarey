Please find and download "STGEI CBT.zip" to get the compiled .jar file of the Java Application.
Please, read the "ReadMe" file after extracting the zip file. It gives a  brief overview of the app.

The "Images" folder is not included in the source code. Thus, required images will not be displayed while running  the app on an IDE.
However, it is compiled with the jar file inside the zip document. Everything works fine when the jar file is run.

Thank You
